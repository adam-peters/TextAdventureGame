# TextAdventureGame

Wanting to expand my experience with different languages and different data structures, I thought creating a text adventure game would be a great way to gain further experience. This project is helping me learn python, expand my knowledge of graphs (using NetworkX), and strengthen my ability to design code structures.

My text adventure game is unique in that it loads its story from a csv file, which anyone can make. The file is loaded into a graph, and then a game managment system creates a game that navigates the graph. A user can then play a game in which they or others have created in Excel or Google Slides.
